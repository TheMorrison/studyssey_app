                          Confronting Emerging Cybersecurity Threats"
                          
                          THREAT 2023, a premier cybersecurity conference, invites submissions for its upcoming gathering. This year's theme," CyberFuture", prompts us to delve into the challenges and opportunities in cybersecurity as we navigate an increasingly digital world.
                          We seek engaging and insightful presentations focusing on emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Computing, and the Bio-Cyber nexus. Special attention will be given to contributions that explore the evolving 'metaverse' and the considerations it entails. In light of the growing digital divide, we also encourage submissions that address policy issues and strategies for cybersecurity in developing nations. Equally, we cannot ignore the rising menace of cyberwarfare, and seek thought provoking submission on this topic.
                          
                          As a collaborative platform for Government, Academia, and the Business sector, THREAT 2023 aims to foster a triple helix of expertise and perspectives. The conference will feature plenary sessions and round table discussions, providing ample opportunities to exchange ideas and collaborate on solutions.
                          Key topics of interest include but are not limited to:
                          Impact and implications of Al on cybersecurity
                          Quantum computing and cybersecurity
                          Cybersecurity at the Bio-Cyber nexus
                          Securing the metaverse
                          Policy cybersecurity in developing nations

                          We welcome original, unpublished research papers not under consideration for publication elsewhere. Papers should be written in English and formatted according to the conference guidelines. Position papers and reviews are also unique security issues and strategies for welcome and should be clearly identified as such. All submissions will be peer reviewed and successful submission will be included in the conference proceedings
